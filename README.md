Helping others capitalize on learning and ambition

As a new Cryptocurrency investor I wasted money trying to find the next big thing, only to lose any profits through the next wave of transactions. 
I want to help people learn about the basics of this new decentralized world, while also staking rewards for those teaching. 
I would love to create an educational game that limits the amount of earned coins, while also creating a sustainably successful platform for those experienced enough to understand what it takes to be residual.
